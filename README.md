## Project description
A simple reaction-based game where players must click the correct option within the time limit set by the difficulty level. The player must choose 1 out of 3 unique options that match the target option. Low difficulty yields a 3 second timespan to choose the correct option, medium difficulty yields 2 seconds, and high difficulty yields only 1 second. This was a school assignment using HTML and Javascript (within the script tag in the html).
### Design specification
1. Player can enter a name, it must be unique, and it will be listed at the bottom in the player list
2. Game will randomly generate 10 options (in a mixed range of 0-9 and A-Z).
3. Of the 10 randomly generated options, only 3 will be randomly displayed as click-able options within the timespan set by the difficulty.
4. All options are unique
5. Simple point system where every correct click will yield 2 points, and wrong click will yield -1 point, negative points are allowed.
6. The score is updated in real time
